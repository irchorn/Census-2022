# Census-2022
This project aims to conduct analysis of the distribution of population and housing units across different zip codes in Brooklyn, NY.
Utilizing data from the U.S. Census Bureau, the project will provide insights into the geographic distribution and demographic composition of the population in various Brooklyn neighborhoods.

The first part of the project, the Geographic Analysis, will focus on the distribution of population and housing units across different zip codes. This will involve visualizing the data to identify patterns and trends in the distribution. The analysis will help in understanding the population density and housing availability in different zip codes, which are crucial factors for urban planning, real estate development, and policy-making.

The second part of the project, the Demographic Analysis, will calculate the ratio of the Total Population under 18 to the Total Population by zip code. This will provide insights into the age composition of the population. This information is valuable for various sectors, such as education and healthcare.

The project leverages Python for data extraction, manipulation, and analysis. Libraries such as pandas will be used for data handling, while plotly is used for data visualization. The project aims to provide valuable insights that can guide decision-making in both public and private sectors.
